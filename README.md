Hey friends, I am Binondi Borthakur and I am building this app to help all the Sketchware developers to build their projects faster using this app. This app provides a variety of features to make it easier for developers to create and share their projects.

**App Features:**

* **Java Codes:** Provides access to a collection of Java code snippets that can be used to add functionality to Sketchware projects.
* **Custom Blocks:** Developers can find custom blocks to extend the functionality of Sketchware.
* **Local Libraries:** Sketch Materials has collections of local libraries that allow developers to import and use local libraries in their Sketchware projects.
* **Lottie Animations:** Includes a library of Lottie animations that can be used to add visual elements to Sketchware projects.
* **Documentation and Tutorials:** Includes comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help developers learn how to use the app.
* **Regular Updates:** The app is regularly updated with new features and improvements.

If you found the app helpful, please rate the project and also download and use the app. If you want to help us or contribute to this project, then please contact me at borthakurbinondi@gmail.com.
